# React + Javascript + Vite

This mini project example helps to understand some of the React core basic concepts like:
- Correct use of useEffect hook when interacting with event listeners - keydown (space bar) and onclick events
- Cleanup function inside useEffect
- Props drilling
- Children composition pattern
- Avoid unnecessary useState for boolean variables that depend on existing local states
